## Overview
**ToDoNoSqlite** is a simple Android application that allows users to add items to a to-do list. The app does not use a database (like SQLite) to store data, so the list resets upon restarting the app. It's an excellent beginner project to learn about using `EditText`, `Button`, and `ListView` in Android, as well as handling basic user input.

- **EditText**: Enter the text of a new item.
- **Add Item Button**: Adds the item to the list displayed in the `ListView`.
- **ListView**: Displays the list of items as they are added.

## Features
- **Add Items**: Enter a new item and click "ADD ITEM" to add it to the list.
- **Clear Input**: The input field clears after each item is added.
- **Toast Notifications**: Shows a message when an item is added or if the input is empty.
